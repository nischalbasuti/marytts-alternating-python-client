"Why the long face?"
"I'm getting sick of work man. I can't take the political bull in the company any more."
"Did you just get your review or something?"
"Yeah, but that's not why I am upset. I just found out another guy got a promotion. He doesn't know how to do anything. He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long."
"That sucks."
"I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies."
"Look on the bright side. At least you have a job."
"Yeah. I shouldn't stress about this anymore. It's not like I can do anything about it."
"Exactly. Instead, we should have some drinks tonight."
"How about a cold bottle of beer."
"Now you're talking."
